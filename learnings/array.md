# Arrays
## Definition
Arrays are a type of [[data-structure|data structure]] which store elements in a continuous manner.
Individual array elements are accessed by indices [0-n-1] for an array of n length.

## Pros
- Small and continuous memory input
- Fast random access

## Cons
- Array size must be statically defined before implementation
- May require copying to resize, which is costly
