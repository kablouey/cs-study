# Algorithms
## Definition
An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions/steps for solving a problem, requiring an input to be manipulated by the algorithm into output.

## Examples
### GPS Navigation
Navigation uses complex algorithms to determine pathing given the starting location and destination inputs

### Chess 
Chess moves are steps of an algorithm. 

### "The" Algorithm
Large algorithms, such as the youtube algorithm, or the spotify algorithm which offer personalised suggestions per user aren't actually an algorithm but usually a set of complex algorithms improved upon over time.
