# Abstract Data Types
## Definition
Describing data in terms of its general characteristics and operations that it should posess, or
The collection of common operations that are accessed through an interface and its characteristics
eg. Integers are ADT's. They have mathematical operations to manipulate numerical data.

## Motivation
We can specify the input and data forms for our algorithms in terms of ADT, and not worry about actual implementation later

## [[data-structures|Data structures]]
are implementations of ADTs
eg. Bit vectors.
